## Overview

The program is a Christmas greeting card that has elements such as music, images, gifs, and shapes made into different types of characters/things that puts you into the Christmas spirit!

## Compiling and Using

File Structure - Organize your project files in a directory. Place the JavaScript file directly in the main directory. Create a folder named "Images" and ensure all image files are stored inside it. Create a folder named "Music" and place the SantaClausIsComingToTown.mp3 (the music file for the card) file inside it.

Running the Code - Open a web browser that supports JavaScript. Navigate to the main project directory (in this case, App.js).

Execute the JavaScript Code - Open the browser's developer console. You can usually do this by right-clicking on the web page, selecting "File", and open the index page. For example, write the following command into App.js, edit it, and then reload the index page. var script = document.createElement('script'); script.src = 'christmas_card.js'; document.head.append(script);

User Interaction - The Christmas greeting card will be automatically generated and displayed on the webpage. No direct user input is required.

Additional Notes -  The code includes audio playback of the "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" melody. Ensure the audio file path is correct. Customize the code by modifying styling, text content, or adding new elements directly in the JavaScript file.

Using the following steps, a Christmas greeting card was created with images, gifs, audio, and shapes using JavaScript.

## Discussion

 Through the coding process, I encountered quite a few troubleshooting errors that I was able to resolve later on, but still gave me some issues. Most commonly I was forgetting about a command whenever I created an element, such as not setting the position to "absolute". One thing that I found most commonly was spelling errors. It was hard to find with how much code I typed up before, leading me to spend minutes at a time just staring at two lines of code, wondering why my image wouldn't show up on the index web page. 
 
  At first throughout the project, I was unsure on how to create images, leading me to paste the image address into the source line instead of inserting a certain command that would make things much more simpler. I tried many things, such as asking chatGPT what went wrong after many attempts. Since that was no help, I got help from my peers and figured out how to write that certain command, which made my project much easier to complete.

  One thing that I noticed when writing the code is that there is a lot of repetition. Though there are varying images and shapes, the code is often the same sequence. This made it much easier to troubleshoot. If I had a mistake on one paragraph of code, I could just look at the previous paragraph and analyze them both together. This made the process easier and led me to experiment with even more elements than what was required.

 This project was rather challenging at first, but it became much easier throughout the coding process.

## Testing

  Testing was a big thing that helped me a lot down the line of my project. With each variable coded, I made sure to reload the index webpage before moving to the next element. If I had a problem with the element, whether it was shape, position, or if it was not appearing on the page, I would add/take away lines of code to make sure the element was showing up properly. And of course, as time went on and more elements appeared, I edited a couple paragraphs of code so that everything could fit together properly on the card. The testing process was helpful because it educated me on what code works and what doesn't, teaching me how to add on to code to make it better and get rid of unnecessary lines of code.

## Extra Credit

 Instead of 13 elements, I added about 37 instead. I don't know if this is applicable for extra credit, but I added it just in case.
 
## Sources used

I found how to use several elements of using JavaScipt and my audio file on youtube.com, as well as google.docs.com to check my spelling errors. I also used google.com for my images that served for my elements.
