# Greeting Card
Author - Kriti Murali

## Project Overview
In this project you will apply JavaScript to the DOM to create a greeting card on an HTML page.  

## Objectives

- [ ] Create HTML elements
- [ ] Use JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements
- [ ] Use variables to manage data

## Specifications

Create a Greeting Card on an HTML page.  Your Greeting Card should include at least 13 different HTML elements.  You must use JavaScript (only) to create and manipulate your elements in such a way that they come together to clearly resemble a picture.   Your Greeting Card should include a variety of colors (at least 5), text, an image, and music. 

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Brainstorm a design that you would like to create.  
- [ ] Locate the App.js file.  Here you will create the basic elements for your page.  You must include at least 13 different elements (See the rubric for details)
- [ ] Once you have created your elements, write code to style your elements into a cohesive "Greeting Card".
- [ ] Include music with your GreetingCard.  Below is an example of how to do this, 

```
var au = new Audio("Music/AllIWantForChristmas.mp3");
au.controls = true;
document.body.appendChild(au);
```

- [ ] Document your code thoroughly as you go with comments
- [ ] Complete the required README using specified guidelines
